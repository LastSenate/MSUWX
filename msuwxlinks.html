            <h1 class="headingtwo">New Website!</h1>
          <h2 class="headingtwo">Hello! This website is going to see some major ovehauls in the future like live cameras and data collected from our stations (and hopefully look a lot better). In all honesty I wasn't sure the website would be as smooth as it is, since this it technically my first time developing a website from scratch. I say only technically, since I've used Flutter in the past, but even then I only ended up using the HTML and CSS for that site. </h2>
          <h2 class="headingtwo">Next for development is to include more options for the forecast page, since options are currently (extremely) limited. This is in addition to implementing NWS's API. Stay tuned!</h2>
